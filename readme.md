# JSF-Solutions 2.0

This is the public repo for students who wish to contribute solutions and examples to lessons from [Learn JavaScript with Zell](https://learnjavascript.today/).

If you need assistance in regards to this repo or want to be added on the contributor's list, you can contact me: [stephen.e.chiang@gmail.com](mailto:stephen.e.chiang@gmail.com) -or- @Stephen on Zell's Slack channel.

## Rules and procedure for contributing

All students are welcome to contribute solutions or request examples. This is a great way to get comfortable with markdown, Git and also learning how to write good examples, explanations, and quality comments.

You might see an occasional semicolon at the end of a statement. I come from a Java background and work daily in TypeScript so they are necessary, but I'll do my best to refrain from using them in plain JS here.

To make a contribution, please make a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

The following information should be included as a minimum.

1.  Lesson and question the solution / example addresses.
2.  Explanation (spell and grammar checked) of your code.
3.  Line comments where needed.
4.  Screenshots if appropriate.

_Comments are really important because this is supplementing and giving your answer context to the student._
